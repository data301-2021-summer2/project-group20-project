## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

In this dataset, I hope to organize the data in a way that can make it easier for a people to browse and decide efficiently and effectively given their own personal criterias. Since my friends and I like to travel, working with this data set can help us optimize our budgets and reduce risks through reviews and ratings. Also, I wanna see how much information I can squeeze out from this raw data.




## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset is provided by a public website called "Inside Airbnb". Within this dataset is a basic list of reviews, ratings, location, prices, and many more. Since this dataset was compiled recently in March 21, 2021, it's information is very much relevant today. This dataset is not only interesting but helpful for people to easily decide which Airbnb they want to stay in.
